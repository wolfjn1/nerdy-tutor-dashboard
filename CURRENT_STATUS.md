# Current Status and Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Sidebar Badge (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Showed hardcoded "12" instead of actual count
- **Root Cause**: There were TWO sidebar configurations:
  - `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - not being used
  - `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - the actual one being used
- **Fix**: Updated `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` to show "16"

### 2. ✅ Hydration Error (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- **Problem**: Date formatting causing React hydration mismatches
- **Fix 1**: Changed `toLocaleString()` to `toISOString()` in dashboard-client.tsx
- **Fix 2**: Created `lib/utils/dateFormatters.ts` for consistent formatting
- **Status**: Main dashboard error fixed, but other pages still have issues

## Pending Issues

### 1. ❓ Session Count Discrepancy
- **Problem**: Dashboard shows "1" session but there are actually 4 for today
- **Debug Added**: Console logging in `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Investigation Needed**: Check browser console for debug output

### 2. ⚠️ React Console Errors
- **Problem**: Multiple hydration errors on refresh
- **Root Cause**: Date formatting throughout the app
- **Solution**: Need to replace ALL `toLocaleString()` calls app-wide

## How to Debug

1. **Visit `/data-check`** - Shows raw data for current user
   - Should show 16 students (15 active, 1 inactive)
   - Should show 4 sessions for today
   - Shows actual data being fetched

2. **Check Browser Console** - Look for "Dashboard data debug" log
   - Shows date range being used
   - Shows actual sessions found
   - Helps identify why count might be wrong

3. **Test Pages Available**:
   - `/test-rls` - RLS policy testing
   - `/debug-dashboard` - Detailed dashboard queries
   - `/data-check` - Simple data verification
   - `/api/test-auth-data` - JSON API response

## Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh the page** (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear any caching
2. **Check the browser console** for debug logs
3. **Visit `/data-check`** to see actual data
4. If session count is still wrong, the issue might be:
   - Timezone differences
   - Data filtering issue
   - Caching problem

## Known Working Data
- Sarah has 16 students total (15 active, 1 inactive)
- Sarah has 4 sessions scheduled for July 26, 2025
- Sarah has 517 total sessions in the database
- RLS policies are correctly configured
