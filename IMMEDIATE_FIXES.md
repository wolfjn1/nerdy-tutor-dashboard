# Immediate Dashboard Fixes

## Current Issues

### 1. Student Count Discrepancies
- **Sidebar**: Shows hardcoded "12" (incorrect)
- **Dashboard**: Shows "15" active students (correct - Sarah has 16 total, 15 active)
- **Database**: Sarah has 16 students total (15 active, 1 inactive)

### 2. React Console Errors
Multiple hydration errors caused by:
- Date formatting with `toLocaleString()` that differs between server/client
- React internal errors from mismatched content

### 3. Testing in Incognito
Incognito mode shouldn't affect the app, but ensure cookies are enabled.

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Update Hardcoded Sidebar Badge
In `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` line 48:
```tsx
// Change from:
badge: '12',
// To:
badge: '16',  // Or remove badge entirely
```

### Fix 2: Test Current Authentication
Visit `/api/test-auth-data` to see exactly what data the current user can access.

### Fix 3: Check Individual Pages
- `/test-rls` - Detailed RLS testing
- `/debug-dashboard` - Raw query results
- `/students` - See if student list shows correctly

## Root Cause
The dashboard IS working correctly:
- Shows 15 active students (correct)
- Shows 1 session today (correct based on screenshot)
- Data is being fetched properly

The only issues are:
1. Hardcoded sidebar badge
2. React hydration errors from date formatting

## Next Steps
1. Fix the hardcoded badge in layout.tsx
2. Replace all `toLocaleString()` calls with consistent date formatting
3. Clear browser cache and test again
