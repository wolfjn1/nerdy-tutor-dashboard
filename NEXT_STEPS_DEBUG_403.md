# Next Steps: Debug 403 Error on Netlify

## What We've Done

1. **Verified Database Setup**
   - Sarah Chen is properly set up in the database
   - She has proper auth_user_id linkage (verified âœ…)
   - She has 4 demo bonuses
   - She has a 'standard' tier

2. **Created Debug Tools**
   - Added `/api/bonuses/debug` endpoint to see what the API sees
   - Created comprehensive SQL scripts for verification
   - Added troubleshooting documentation

3. **Cleaned Up & Pushed**
   - Removed temporary/user-specific scripts
   - Organized remaining scripts
   - Pushed everything to GitHub

## Next Steps to Fix 403

Since Sarah Chen is properly set up but still getting 403 errors, the issue is likely one of:

### 1. Wait for Netlify Deployment
The code was just pushed. Wait a few minutes for Netlify to build and deploy.

### 2. Test Debug Endpoint
Once deployed, visit:
```
https://nerdy-tutor-dashboard.netlify.app/api/bonuses/debug
```

This will show:
- Current authenticated user
- What tutor record it finds
- Whether it can access bonuses
- Any errors

### 3. Clear Browser Cache Completely
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use an incognito window

### 4. Check Supabase Connection
The debug endpoint will reveal if:
- The API can't authenticate you
- It's finding a different user than expected
- The RLS policies aren't working

### 5. If Still Not Working
Share the output from the debug endpoint - it will tell us exactly what's wrong.

## Most Likely Causes

1. **Browser Cache** - Old auth tokens cached
2. **Cookie Issues** - Auth cookies not being sent properly
3. **Middleware Issue** - Something in the auth middleware
4. **Different Supabase Instance** - Double-check environment variables

The debug endpoint will pinpoint which one it is!
